        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I am a web developer who brings together clean engineering and creative storytelling. I love turning ideas
            into
            interfaces that feel intuitive, expressive, and a little bit magical. My approach combines strong full-stack
            fundamentals, accessibility, and design-minded thinking—always focused on building experiences that work
            beautifully
            on any device.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have a background in art direction, worldbuilding, and visual design, which deeply influences my work. I
            think a
            lot about atmosphere, storytelling, and how interfaces feel—not just how they function. Exploring
            interactive design
            has strengthened my ability to build organized UI systems and think through user experience from concept to
            final
            polish.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of web development, I stay curious and creative. I love rock climbing, snowboarding, spending time
            with my two
            dogs, exploring music, and writing. I also have a strong appreciation for tattoo art and graphic design,
            which shapes
            how I think about composition and visual style.
